\section{Introduction}
In today's interconnected world, the growing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices brings both convenience and security challenges. With these devices operating in resource-constrained environments, its important to ensure their protection against cyber threats.

This paper explores the realm of lightweight cryptography (LWC), specialized cryptographic algorithms designed to secure IoT devices efficiently. We delve into the need for LWC, ongoing standardization efforts by institutions like NIST, and introduce Ascon, an innovative encryption scheme aimed at bolstering IoT security.

Our aim is to highlight the vital role of LWC in fortifying IoT ecosystems and advancing security standards for resource-limited devices.
