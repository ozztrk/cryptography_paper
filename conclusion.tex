\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we've examined the significance of lightweight cryptography, particularly in securing resource-constrained environments like IoT. Through our exploration of Ascon's cryptographic primitives, including AEAD, hashing, and permutations, we've gained insights into the latest advancements in this field.
While recent progress in lightweight cryptography is promising, ongoing threats demand robust solutions. NIST's standardization efforts, exemplified by Ascon's efficiency and security, highlight the importance of tailored cryptographic algorithms for IoT security.
Looking forward, continued research and collaboration are crucial to staying ahead of evolving threats. By advancing lightweight cryptography, we can ensure the safety and reliability of IoT ecosystems in an increasingly connected world.
