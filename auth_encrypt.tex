The Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) primitive is the most common primitive for data encryption and is suitable for most needs. \cite{GoogleTinkAEAD}
\newline
AEAD has the following properties: \newline
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Secrecy:} Nothing about the plaintext is known, except its length.
    \item \textbf{Authenticity:} It is impossible to change the encrypted plaintext underlying the ciphertext without being detected.
    \item \textbf{Symmetric:} Encrypting the plaintext and decrypting the ciphertext is done with the same key.
    \item \textbf{Randomization:} Encryption is randomized. Two messages with the same plaintext yield different ciphertexts. Attackers cannot know which ciphertext corresponds to a given plaintext. If you want to avoid this, use Deterministic AEAD instead.
\end{itemize}
