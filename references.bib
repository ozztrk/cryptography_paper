abstract = {When a message is transformed into a ciphertext in a way designed to protect both its privacy and authenticity, there may be additional information, such as a packet header, that travels alongside the ciphertext (at least conceptually) and must get authenticated with it. We formalize and investigate this authenticated-encryption with associated-data (AEAD) problem. Though the problem has long been addressed in cryptographic practice, it was never provided a definition or even a name. We do this, and go on to look at efficient solutions for AEAD, both in general and for the authenticated-encryption scheme OCB. For the general setting we study two simple ways to turn an authenticated-encryption scheme that does not support associated-data into one that does: nonce stealing and ciphertext translation. For the case of OCB we construct an AEAD-scheme by combining OCB and the pseudorandom function PMAC, using the same key for both algorithms. We prove that, despite "interaction" between the two schemes when using a common key, the combination is sound. We also consider achieving AEAD by the generic composition of a nonce-based, privacy-only encryption scheme and a pseudorandom function.},

abstract="This paper proposes a novel construction, called duplex, closely related to the sponge construction, that accepts message blocks to be hashed and--at no extra cost--provides digests on the input blocks received so far. It can be proven equivalent to a cascade of sponge functions and hence inherits its security against single-stage generic attacks. The main application proposed here is an authenticated encryption mode based on the duplex construction. This mode is efficient, namely, enciphering and authenticating together require only a single call to the underlying permutation per block, and is readily usable in, e.g., key wrapping. Furthermore, it is the first mode of this kind to be directly based on a permutation instead of a block cipher and to natively support intermediate tags. The duplex construction can be used to efficiently realize other modes, such as a reseedable pseudo-random bit sequence generators and a sponge variant that overwrites part of the state with the input block rather than to XOR it in.",

edition = {1st},
abstract = {In this introductory textbook the author explains the key topics in cryptography. He takes a modern approach, where defining what is meant by "secure" is as important as creating something that achieves that goal, and security definitions are central to the discussion throughout. The chapters in Part 1 offer a brief introduction to the mathematical foundations: modular arithmetic, groups, finite fields, and probability; primality testing and factoring; discrete logarithms; elliptic curves; and lattices. Part 2 of the book shows how historical ciphers were broken, thus motivating the design of modern cryptosystems since the 1960s; this part also includes a chapter on information-theoretic security. Part 3 covers the core aspects of modern cryptography: the definition of security; modern stream ciphers; block ciphers and modes of operation; hash functions, message authentication codes, and key derivation functions; the "naive" RSA algorithm; public key encryption and signature algorithms; cryptography based on computational complexity; and certificates, key transport and key agreement. Finally, Part 4 addresses advanced prot ocols, where the parties may have different or even conflicting security goals: secret sharing schemes; commitments and oblivious transfer; zero-knowledge proofs; and secure multi-party computation. The author balances a largely non-rigorous stylemany proofs are sketched onlywith appropriate formality and depth. For example, he uses the terminology of groups and finite fields so that the reader can understand both the latest academic research and "real-world" documents such as application programming interface descriptions and cryptographic standards. The text employs colour to distinguish between public and private information, and all chapters include summaries and suggestions for further reading. This is a suitabletextbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, mathematics and engineering, and for self-study by professionals in information security. While the appendix summarizes most of the basic algebra and notation required, it is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of discrete mathematics, probability, and elementary calculus.}

A special focus is on algebraic structures, which are used in many cryptographic constructions and also in post-quantum systems.

The compression function is usually designed from scratch or made out of a block-cipher. In this paper, we introduce a new security notion for hash-functions, stronger than collision-resistance. Under this notion, the arbitrary length hash function H must behave as a random oracle when the fixed-length building block is viewed as a random oracle or an ideal block-cipher. The key property is that if a particular construction meets this definition, then any cryptosystem proven secure assuming H is a random oracle remains secure if one plugs in this construction (still assuming that the underlying fixed-length primitive is ideal). In this paper, we show that the current design principle behind hash functions such as SHA-1 and MD5 --- the (strengthened) Merkle-Damg{\aa}rd transformation --- does not satisfy this security notion. We provide several constructions that provably satisfy this notion; those new constructions introduce minimal changes to the plain Merkle-Damg{\aa}rd construction and are easily implementable in practice.},
