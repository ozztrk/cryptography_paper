abstract = {When a message is transformed into a ciphertext in a way designed to protect both its privacy and authenticity, there may be additional information, such as a packet header, that travels alongside the ciphertext (at least conceptually) and must get authenticated with it. We formalize and investigate this authenticated-encryption with associated-data (AEAD) problem. Though the problem has long been addressed in cryptographic practice, it was never provided a definition or even a name. We do this, and go on to look at efficient solutions for AEAD, both in general and for the authenticated-encryption scheme OCB. For the general setting we study two simple ways to turn an authenticated-encryption scheme that does not support associated-data into one that does: nonce stealing and ciphertext translation. For the case of OCB we construct an AEAD-scheme by combining OCB and the pseudorandom function PMAC, using the same key for both algorithms. We prove that, despite "interaction" between the two schemes when using a common key, the combination is sound. We also consider achieving AEAD by the generic composition of a nonce-based, privacy-only encryption scheme and a pseudorandom function.},

abstract="This paper proposes a novel construction, called duplex, closely related to the sponge construction, that accepts message blocks to be hashed and--at no extra cost--provides digests on the input blocks received so far. It can be proven equivalent to a cascade of sponge functions and hence inherits its security against single-stage generic attacks. The main application proposed here is an authenticated encryption mode based on the duplex construction. This mode is efficient, namely, enciphering and authenticating together require only a single call to the underlying permutation per block, and is readily usable in, e.g., key wrapping. Furthermore, it is the first mode of this kind to be directly based on a permutation instead of a block cipher and to natively support intermediate tags. The duplex construction can be used to efficiently realize other modes, such as a reseedable pseudo-random bit sequence generators and a sponge variant that overwrites part of the state with the input block rather than to XOR it in.",
