  abstract     = {Ascon, DryGASCON, and Shamash are submissions to NIST's lightweight cryptography standardization process and have similar designs. We analyze these algorithms against subspace trails, truncated differentials, and differential-linear distinguishers. We provide probability one 4-round subspace trails for DryGASCON-256, 3-round subspace trails for DryGASCON-128, and 2-round subspace trails for Shamash permutations. Moreover, we provide the first 3.5-round truncated differential and 5-round differential-linear distinguisher for DryGASCON-128. Finally, we improve the data and time complexity of the 4 and 5-round differential-linear attacks on Ascon.},
